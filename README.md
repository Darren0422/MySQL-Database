## Description 
You have been asked to create a project management system for a small structural engineering firm called “Poised”. Poised does the engineering needed to ensure the structural integrity of various buildings. 
They want you to create a Java program that they can use to keep track of the many projects on which they work.

Poised stores the following information for each project that they work on:
- Project number.
- Project name.
- What type of building is being designed? E.g. House, apartment block or store, etc.
- The physical address for the project.
- ERF number.
- The total fee being charged for the project.
- The total amount paid to date.
- Deadline for the project.
- The name, telephone number, email address, and physical address of the architect for the project.
- The name, telephone number, email address, and physical address of the contractor for the project.
- The name, telephone number, email address, and physical address of the customer for the project.

Poised wants to be able to use your program to do the following:
- Capture information about new projects. If a project name is not provided when the information is captured, name the project using the surname of the customer.
  - For example, a house being built by Mike Tyson would be called "House Tyson" and an apartment block owned by Jared Goldman would be called "Apartment Goldman."
- Update information about existing projects. Information may need to be adjusted at different stages throughout the lifecycle of a project. For example, the deadline might change after a meeting with various stakeholders.
- Finalise existing projects. When a project is finalised, the following should happen:
  - The project should be marked as "finalised" in some way and the completion date should be added.
- See a list of projects that still need to be completed (have not been finalised).
- See a list of projects that are past the due date.
- Find and select a project by entering either the project number or project name.

## Importance 
This repository is important as it shows that I am able to persist and manipulate data. This project should make it
clear that I can follow a development process to create a data-driven program that is debugged, tested, refactored, documented and
that meets a client’s specifications. Additonally, this repository shows my understanding and comprehension of Java, SQL, MySQL and databases.
